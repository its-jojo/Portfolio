      <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Jyoti Mehra, a passionate and driven second-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student. I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and the MERN Stack, I bring both creativity and technical expertise to web development. I also have hands-on experience with advanced Microsoft Excel, making me proficient in handling data-driven tasks and analytical work.

I'm currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills, contribute meaningfully to real-world projects, and continue learning alongside experienced professionals.

ðŸ’¡ I believe in lifelong learning and am always eager to embrace new challenges in the tech space. Letâ€™s connect and grow together! ðŸš€
      </p>
